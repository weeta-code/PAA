## Example Code implementation of my Procedural Animation Algo

Extended documentation can be found here: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_ASBF2KO-8qQYrZD44LU95QHYrgxCNk2jWNvZaIp0_M/edit?usp=sharing

See C++/C files for implementation. Python file is solely for parametric customizeable graph using streamlit. Feel free to implement into your own simulations/game engines!

## To use:
* Run this copy&pasted command: mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
* Move the .py file into the /build directory and run it
